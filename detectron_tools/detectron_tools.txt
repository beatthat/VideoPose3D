To split the video you plan on using try to use ffmpeg.

Splitting command:  ffmpeg -i ice.mp4 -r 25/1 splitted_scating/output%04d.png
Video Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke0iusvydl8
I downloaded the video named it ice.mp4 and called the ffmpeg command like this. This will take a while because the video has many frames.

Now you can run detectron. Replace the infer_simple provided in this folder with the infer_simple from detectron (or just rename it). Run the infer_simple and the exported poses will be stored at your location (change 'pathToSave')

Now you created everything you need as Input for VideoPose3D!
